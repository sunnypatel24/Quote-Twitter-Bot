# Quote-Twitter-Bot
A Twitter bot that will tweet quotes from a quotation website. Made using tweepy in Python.

Web scraping is done from the following website:
"http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php"

For the "auth" variable, enter in your specific account's keys and tokens into the placeholder text with quotations included.

"quotes.txt" contains all quotes tweeted from the bot and is written into with the quote and author, and then read from by the bot to tweet the quote to the twitter timeline.
